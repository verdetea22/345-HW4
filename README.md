### Design
#### 1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
##### The most helpful part of thinking and going about our design for the finance bot was having a sense of direction, and having it be consistent between all of our group members. With the basics of our strategy and end goal in mind, all of the groupmates not only knew 'what' they were tasked to do, but also were able to have an idea 'how' we would go about it. Whether that be with the help of frameworks or studying each others work, the team knew what assets they had to help in the planning and creation of our code. Being on the same page as one another in terms of general design was by far the most helpful part.
#### 2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
##### The most difficult part about the design aspect of our project was agreeing on the specifics of our end product. The vision for the bot changes a few times for various reasons, whether it be for aesthetic purposes or in terms of what we were/weren't able to accomplish. This was alleviated by trial and error, as well as strong communication. The platform was ever-evolving, and through constant reevaluation by the team we were able to come to a consensus of the end-vision. If I had to do anything differently, it would be to spend time earlier on with visual software with the team to decide how the physical design of the platform would look, to lessen the amount of time spent on GUI later on in the project. However, I honestly am very happy with how this project came out and I do not look ack and regret the way the team spent our time. 
#### 3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
#### For my next project, I would be interested to try a more level-oriented design, starting the process with the top most level with the most significant features. While this strategy does require extensive understanding of the problem, as long as the developers abided by an iterative implementative process, we can have a very strong development, strategy with room to refactor with more functionality later on.

### Implementation 
#### 1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
##### The most helpful part about implementing, testing and integration of the bot project was the powers of Github. While this may seem like a obvious answer, it is such an obvious choice because its entire purpose is to host working data of several developers and keep the progress of both the individual and the group as a whole well organized and informed during every step. More specificallu, the use of branches and pull requests was particularly helpful with the implemenation, testing and integration aspects. By each team memeber having their own branch, they could implement and test as they please without confliciting with one another as they worked simulanteously. Pull requests were vital to each of our indiviual integration onto the main project branch, where one could compare their work against what already existed, mitigating many potential issues. 
#### 2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
##### The most difficult part, for me personally, was my inexperience using many new frameworks, APIs and services for project. In particular, I had very limited knowledge of React, and none with Bootstrap, Firebase and FusionCharts API. However, our project was heavily dependant on these services and I took it upon myself with ambition to learn more about these integral tools in the world of front and back end development. There was certainly a learning curve to this challenge, and often I spent more time debugging and reading (and rereading) documention than I did coding, but with perserverence and asking my groupmates for help I was able to accomplish much and learn even more.

##### There are various different kinds
