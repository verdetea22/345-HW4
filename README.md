### Design
#### 1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
##### The most helpful part of thinking and going about our design for the finance bot was having a sense of direction, and having it be consistent between all of our group members. With the basics of our strategy and end goal in mind, all of the groupmates not only knew 'what' they were tasked to do, but also were able to have an idea 'how' we would go about it. Whether that be with the help of frameworks or studying each others work, the team knew what assets they had to help in the planning and creation of our code. Being on the same page as one another in terms of general design was by far the most helpful part.
#### 2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
##### The most difficult part about the design aspect of our project was agreeing on the specifics of our end product. The vision for the bot changes a few times for various reasons, whether it be for aesthetic purposes or in terms of what we were/weren't able to accomplish. This was alleviated by trial and error, as well as strong communication. The platform was ever-evolving, and through constant reevaluation by the team we were able to come to a consensus of the end-vision. If I had to do anything differently, it would be to spend time earlier on with visual software with the team to lessen the amount of time spent on GUI later on in the project. However, I honestly am very happy with how this project came out and I do not look ack and regret the way the team spent our time.
